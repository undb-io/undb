            This PR merges the main branch back into develop.
            This happens to ensure that the updates that happend on the release branch, i.e. CHANGELOG and manifest updates are also present on the develop branch.

      # if needed, you can checkout the latest main here, build artifacts and publish / deploy them somewhere
      # the create-release action has an output `upload_url` output that you can use to upload assets
